          Hey there! I’m Maryam, the creator of Learn to Code With Me. I am
          completely self-taught, with a lot left to learn and in teaching
          myself tech skills, I uncovered a passion for teaching others. Today,
          I’m driven by the goal of making education affordable and accessible
          to all. Since I began gaining valuable digital skills, I’ve been able
          to make more money, pursue passions that I care about, and,
          ultimately, enjoy freedom and flexibility.
